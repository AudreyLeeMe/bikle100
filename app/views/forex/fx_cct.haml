%h4#woq Week Of Quarter (WOQ)
When I trade currencies in the Forex market, does the first week in a quarter resemble the first week in other quarters? 
How about the last week or any arbitrary week?
%br/
%br/

If the answer is yes, then I do have a Current Correlation Trend (for week of quarter).
%br/
It seems plausible that correlation trends could exist in the Forex market.  As a consumer I have certain bills which come due once a month.  Also I have taxes which are due once a quarter and once a year.  Obviously large corporations, banks, and governments have bills which need to get paid.  These payments might produce correlation trends in the Forex market.

As I write this, the date is 2010-11-02.  Currently I am in the 6th week of the 4th quarter of 2010.
%br/

That means I can compare weeks 1 through 5 of this quarter to weeks 1 through 5 of previous quarters going back several years.
%br/

And I can study weeks 1 through 14 of the 3rd quarter of 2010 which began on Thursday July 1 2010.

The source of my data is the Federal Reserve:

%h4#wom Week Of Month (WOM)

What is the best week of the month to be bearish on eur_usd currency pair?
Does the first week in a month resemble the first week in other months?

Using data I acquired from the Fed, 
I looked for evidence that buying or shorting a specific pair for a given week of the month yielded a strong pattern.

%h4#pow Period Of Week (POW)

A Day-Of-Week trade is opened at midnight GMT and closed the following midnight GMT.
Is midnight GMT the best time to open a trade?
I suspect probably not since the day has 24 hours in it.
Perhaps it is better to open a trade at 09:00 GMT or maybe noon?

%br/

I developed the idea of a Period-Of-Week to help me answer this question.
