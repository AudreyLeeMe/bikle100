I found no evidence of strong correlation trends for Week Of Month (WOM).

The software I used to go on this quest can be found here:

Week-of-Month queries can be useful if I have a strong opinion about
the direction of either a particular currency or a particular
currencly pair.

For example, on 2010-11-03, the Fed publicized a policy which some call "Quantitative Easing":

%a(href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Quantitative+Easing" target="g")
  https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Quantitative+Easing

%br/
%br/

An anecdotal scan of the media suggests that this policy should force
consumers, banks, and businesses to have a bearish opinion about USD.

This is actually a big topic but I suspect that bearish sentiment towards USD is rising.

If you are a USD bear, the query listed below may be of interest to you.

It shows, for 2009 and 2010, the average hourly rate of return for various currency pairs.

I sorted the list by absolute value of the return:

Notice that the first row in the report is for the gbp_usd pair.  If you trade this pair, you will use USD to buy GBP.
If USD is falling, it makes sense that the gain for this pair would be positive.

The second row in the report is for the usd_chf pair.  In this trade you would use CHF to buy USD.

A USD bear however, would instead use CHF to short, not buy, USD.

Since USD has been falling in value it makes sense that the gain for the usd_chf pair would be negative.

So why is the above report useful to a USD bear?

It is useful because it shows (in sorted order) the most lucrative Week of Month trades.

The first row in the report shows that on the 5th week of the month in 2009 and 2010 the gbp_usd pair had an approximate gain of 0.95108 pips / hour.  

The Forex Market trades 24 x 5 hours / week. 
 
So this is a rate of return of (0.95108 pips / hour) x (24 x 5 hours / week) which is 114 pips / week.

Most Forex traders use 250 pips of collateral to trade $1.

So 114 pips / week in percentage terms is (114 / 250)x100% which is a 46% return in 1 week.

My attitude is this:

Markets are fickle; it seems plausible that 2011, 2012, 2013 will yield very different result than 2009 and 2010.

But, it also it seems possible that the USD will fall for a long time for several reasons:

%ul
  %li The stated policy of the Fed is stimulate the US economy with easy money
  %li Export based economies which sell many goods or resources tend to build a strong currency
  %li Australia, Canada, and Japan have export based economies
  %li USA has an import based economy
