%h5 Day Of Month (dom2010_1107)


If you have software talents, and a desire to duplicate my results,
you will find a copy of the software I used to generate the SQL reports for this page.
The software is here:

I used google to locate some forex data which contains prices for currency pairs at the hourly level:
%br/
%br/

%a(href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=forex+historical+data" target="g")
  https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=forex+historical+data
%br/
%br/
For 2009, and 2010 I compared the data to data I get from my broker.  I am satisfied that the data is accurate.
I am hesitant to share the URL because I do not know the owner's attitude about my analysis of the data.
If you want the data, it is easy to find via google rather than me.

Hourly data seems to be well suited for building effective queries for displaying lucrative Day-Of-Month trades.
%br/
%br/

I aggregated my hourly Forex into a view named hdom.
I constructed hdom so it has these column names:

%ul
  %li pair (aud_usd, usd_cad, etc...)
  %li day_of_month (1 through 31)
  %li avg_nhgain (average normalized hourly gain )
  %li sum_nhgain (sum of normalized hourly gain )
  %li count_nhgain (row count behind each aggregation)
  %li stddev_nhgain (standard deviation of normalized hourly gains)

Next, I ran a simple query against the view:

%pre
  :preserve
    23:38:03 SQL> -- For each pair, look at dom WHERE ydate > '2009-01-01'
    23:38:03 SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hdom AS

Notice that I constrained the output from the above query so I see only trades which yielded more than 1 pip / hour after 2009-01-01.

Had I not done that, the query would have returned 186 rows which would be a nested list of 31 rows for each of the 6 currency pairs.

%br/
%br/

The first row in the above report describes the most productive trade.  
This row tells me that had I shorted the usd_chf pair after 2009-01-01
during every hour of the 31st day of months with 31 days,
I would have averaged a gain of almost 3 pips per hour for a total gain of 511 pips.

When I look at the above report, it is difficult for me to see which trades are USD bearish and which are bullish.
This is important information to me so I wrote some SQL to see it:

The way I use this data to trade is simple.

First, I ask myself which currencies I am bullish on and which I am bearish on.

%br/
%br/
Currently my sentiments are this:
%ul
  %li Bullish: AUD, CAD, CHF
  %li Bearish: USD
  %li Neutral: EUR, GBP, JPY

Next, I look at the calendar.  Today is 2010-11-08.
I see that since 2009-01-01, on the 8th of every month, that a short position held on usd_chf (sell USD, buy CHF)
would have gained on average almost 2 pips / hour.
I also see that 390 separate hours existed on the 8th of a month since 2009-01-01.
If I had shorted usd_chf for all 390 of those hours, I would have gained about 692 pips.
Since I am bearish on USD and bullish on CHF, I feel comfortable holding a short position in usd_chf for 24 hours.

How large of a position would I be comfortable with?
I start to answer this question by looking at the value of STDDEV_NHGAIN in the above report.
I see this number: .001594953
%br/
That number corresponds to a standard deviation of about 16 pips / hour.
I estimate that 4 times that number is near the maximum I could lose in a 24 hour period which is 4 x 16 pips which is 64 pips.

%br/
%br/
I know that 64 pips on a $10,000 position corresponds to about $64 and I know that I'd be comfortable if I lost $64.
So, the size of the position I would be comfortable with would be $10,000.
My broker sets the minimum that I can trade on this pair at $25,000.
That amount is beyond what I comfortable with so I would not make the trade.

Anyone who trades in the Forex market should have a clear understanding of the amount of risk connected to each trade.
Simple common sense combined with a small amount of SQL gives you a start at quantifying Forex risk.
